# AWS CodeBuild CI/CD Pipeline with Terraform
This project demonstrates the configuration of a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using AWS CodeBuild and Terraform.

## Project Structure
 `main.tf`: Contains the main Terraform configuration.
 
 `variables.tf` : Defines the input variables for Terraform.
 
`outputs.tf`: Specifies the outputs of the Terraform configuration.

`buildspec.yml`: Defines the build commands and settings for AWS CodeBuild.

`README.md`: Project documentation.
## Prerequisites
 - AWS account with appropriate permissions.
 -  Terraform installed on your local machine.
 - AWS CLI configured with your credentials.
 - Basic understanding of AWS CodeBuild and Terraform.
## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository:
```

cd Terraform-AWS-CodeBuild-CICD-Pipeline
```
2. Initialize Terraform:
```
terraform init
```
3. Review and Apply the Terraform Configuration:

 * Plan the Deployment:
```
terraform plan
```
* Apply the Configuration:
```
terraform apply
``` 
Note: Review the plan output carefully before applying.

4. Configure AWS CodeBuild:

Ensure that the buildspec.yml file is correctly set up to define the build commands and settings for your project.
5. Trigger the Build:

Initiate a build in AWS CodeBuild to start the CI/CD pipeline.
## Application Usage
